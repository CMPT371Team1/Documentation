Peer review #1 - Risks
The first formal inspection was held on Tuesday, Jan 17 at 4:10 PM on Risk analysis. The inspection was led by Tushita Patel, the Project Lead because a Risk Officer was not yet assigned. 
Because of shortage of time, the material could not be made available to all members several days before the day of the inspection. A rough copy of the Risk evaluation was shared with the group a day prior to the inspection and everybody was notified about this exception.
First, the strategies to analyze risks were discussed as well as some key terms and their meanings such as Mitigation plans and Contingency plans. 
Second, some of the risks that were pre-dentified were discussed, and mitigation and contingency plans for those risks were evaluated and noted.
Third, attendees were encouraged to suggest more risks that were not covered. These risks were discussed in depth, along with their mitigation and contingency plans.
Lastly, nominations for risk officer position were held, and Ryan Tetland volunteered to take on the responsibilites of a risk officer.
The Risk report was then passed on to Ryan to edit and turn into a well-documented report to go along with ID1 submission.


Peer review #2 - Schedule and Documentation Structure 
Date, time and location: Jan 27, 5:30 p.m. S371
The schedule (timeline) for the entire coursework as well as the documentation structure was deemed necessary for the group to review. The goal was to re-inform the group about the setup as well as to get feedback for improvement in ease of usability and accessibility of these particulars as they should be frequently utilized. A final version was made available to the members seven days prior to the review to make it convenient for everybody to come prepared to the review. This inspection was led by Tushita Patel, who also created the timeline and documentation structure. During the inspection, upcoming deadlines and general format for each ID duration was finalized. The general format includes deadlines for development, risk report, risk scans, as well as suitable day for debriefing and client meetings. A date for a bug party was also decided to suit everybody's preferences - Saturday Feb 18. It was also decided that no major meetings would be held during the week after February break because of high priority on midterms. Additional deadlines for ID 4 and 5 - User Documentation, tutorials and final defect reports were also proposed and agreed upon by all team members.

Peer Review #3 - Design & UI
On February 10th at 3:30, Dylan held an inspection that covered the overall design of the front-end of our application. Although Dylan was not the only person who created the user interface, he was in charge of overlooking the front-end in this deliverable. Prior to this review we had a meeting with our client and some changes were outlined that he would like us to make to the current user interface. Since the changes our client made directly affected the content of the inspection, we first went over how to integrate his changes then continued the inspection. Everyone had lots of comments to make on the user interface and there were lots of open discussion about how we could improve the interface while keeping the changes our client made in mind. All of the UI changes discussed are documented here. Along with the changes to the UI, there were a few other minor changes to the data structures. We decided to inspect the user interface fairly early in the project because our goal for the deliverable was aimed towards familiarizing ourselves with the framework, and less time was put into building upon the design at that time.

Peer Review #4 - Testing plan
On Feb 13th, 3:30 PM, Jeremy held an inspection covering the testing plan for the current and future ID's. A template for Use Cases was shown to display the detailed test specifications between the transitions of the UI flow diagrams. End-to-end test progress was shown and demonstrated, noting that changes would be made to accomodate newly developed features in the coming ID. Issues with the unit test runner tool Karma were informed to the development team leaders, and questions to ask Prof. Osgood about unit testing were formulated. Plans to update the test matrix, defect report, flow diagrams, and use cases were given. The dev leads let the testers know about the extra time required for development, and that the testers would be receiving the code a day later than previously scheduled. Due to conflicts in schedules and other classes occuring during this review, another inspection covering the same topic will be held on Sat. Feb 18th for those who missed the first one.

Peer Review #5 - Build files
Date, time and location: Feb 14, 4:30 p.m. S371
A peer review was held on Feb 14 whose main purpose was to disseminate information to the group about the build.  It was lead by Chris 
Mykota-Reid and lasted roughly 1 hour.  The artifact was the build as of the end of ID1 and was made available 1 week prior to the 
inspection.  During the peer review the .travis.yml was went over as well as the scripts used in the build first starting with the overall
yml and what the different headers ment and then going into the individual scripts.  Each command in the script was explained (as best as 
Chris could) and questions were encouraged at the end of each script.  The main focus was communicating that these are just bash
scripts so that if Chris were to fall ill people would at least have a place to start.  Most people didn't know anything about the build
so if Chris was to fall sick or ill the consequences could be severe.  This peer review was ment to mitigate that.  A few suggestions were
made towards formatting of the script by Gaurav and Dylan added in another command for ionic package installation but besides that it was 
all lecture from Chris and questions from the group.
