Coding Style Guide
It was initially decided that we would follow Google JavaScript Guidelines (found here: https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html). However, because this resource is very detailed and extensive and because we will also be using TypeScript, it was deemed best to create our own little guideline which serves our purpose. The guideline highlights the salient features of the style that all developers should follow, along with useful examples to quicken referencing. 
The summarized guide and sample was published on the wiki page: https://github.com/CMPT371Team1/Project/wiki/(Rough)-Coding-Style-Example-(JavaScript)
