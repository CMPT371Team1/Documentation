Handing in project documentation at each of the 5 incremental deliverables required to provide
information to the instructor and tutor as to the state of the project.
- Clear documentation of requirements
- Simple prototypes for the UI (mostly on paper) and for areas of particular risk
- Initial and ongoing contact with clients/users to validate the requirements and receive feedback on
product progress. A documented form of this contact should take place at least one time per
incremental deliverable. Where this is not possible due to continued unavailability of or lack of
communication from a client for more than one iteration of the project, please notify the instructor
immediately. 
-Aggressive up-front and ongoing risk management, including through an accountable risk officer. This
should include risk scanning on a periodic basis (at least once for each deliverable).
- Creation and updating of the identity and status of clear binary “mini-milestones” for the product. Each
such mini-milestone should indicate that a task is either complete or not complete
