Purpose: Go over testing tools, explain end-to-end testing, decide on approach to UI testing
Summary: Need to ask Osgood if testing is done in another branch, find a new mocking framework because Angular-Mock probably doesn't work with Angular2 (do we need one?), need to research how to test on iOS and Android.
