Peer review #1 - Risks
The first formal inspection was held on Tuesday, Jan 17 at 4:10 PM on Risk analysis. The inspection was led by Tushita Patel, the Project Lead because a Risk Officer was not yet assigned. 
First, the strategies to analyze risks were discussed as well as some key terms and their meanings such as Mitigation plans and Contingency plans. 
Second, some of the risks that were pre-dentified were discussed, and mitigation and contingency plans for those risks were evaluated and noted.
Third, attendees were encouraged to suggest more risks that were not covered. These risks were discussed in depth, along with their mitigation and contingency plans.
Lastly, nominations for risk officer position were held, and Ryan Tetland volunteered to take on the responsibilites of a risk officer.
The Risk report was then passed on to Ryan to edit and turn into a well-documented report to go along with ID1 submission.
